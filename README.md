## Story Generator

A simple but fun console program that creates a randomly selected story based on user input.  
There are 5 possible story templates, and the user has no idea which will be chosen when he is entering the different values.  
This program is modified from one I wrote for fun when I was in my first programming course. Now the code looks a good bit nicer, and the added randomization makes it a lot more fun.
